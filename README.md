# Landing Page Project - Odin Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal is to build a responsive **landing page** using **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on layout, styling, and Flexbox fundamentals.

You are provided with a **design mockup** and a **style guide**, and your task is to recreate the page as accurately as possible. The focus is on structure, layout, and responsiveness rather than exact pixel-perfect replication.
